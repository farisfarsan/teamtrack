# 🔧 Render Build Fix - Directory Issue

## ❌ **Problem Identified:**
The build was failing because Django commands were running from the wrong directory. The error:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'accounts'

cd teamtrack
```

## 🔧 **Additional Fix Needed:**

```bash
cd teamtrack && gunicorn teamtrack.wsgi:application --settings=teamtrack.settings_render
```

**Or create a start script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd teamtrack
gunicorn teamtrack.wsgi:application --settings=teamtrack.settings_render
```

## 📋 **Steps to Fix:**

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**
2. **Click on your service** (teamtrack1)
3. **Go to Settings tab**
4. **Update Start Command to:**
   ```
   cd teamtrack && gunicorn teamtrack.wsgi:application --settings=teamtrack.settings_render
   ```
5. **Save and redeploy**

## 🎯 **Expected Result:**

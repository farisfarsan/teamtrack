## Option 2: Problem-Solving Focus

💡 **Solved a real business problem with TeamTrack!**

Our team needed a centralized system to manage tasks, track attendance, and coordinate across different departments. Instead of using multiple tools, I built an integrated solution.

**The Challenge:**
- Scattered task management across different platforms
- Manual attendance tracking
- Poor team coordination
- No centralized analytics

**The Solution:**
Built TeamTrack - a Django-based platform that brings everything together:
🎯 Unified task management with role-based permissions
📊 Real-time attendance tracking with notifications
📈 Team performance analytics and dashboards
👥 Multi-team support (Tech, Design, Product, Marketing)

**Results:**
- Streamlined team workflows
- Better accountability and tracking
- Improved team coordination
- Professional-grade solution deployed on Render.com

Sometimes the best solution is building exactly what your team needs!
